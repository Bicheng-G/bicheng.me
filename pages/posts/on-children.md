And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.

And he said:

_Your children are not your children._

_They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself._

_They come through you but not from you,_

_And though they are with you yet they belong not to you._

_You may give them your love but not your thoughts,_

_For they have their own thoughts._

_You may house their bodies but not their souls,_

_For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams._

_You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you._

_For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday._

_You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth._

_The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far._

_Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;_

_For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable._

-- From _The Prophet_ by Kahlil Gibran

<br>

一位怀抱婴儿的母亲说道：请为我们谈谈孩子吧。

先知答道：

_你的孩子并非你的孩子。_

_他们是生命对于自身渴望而诞生的孩子_

_他们通过你来到这个世界，却非因你而来。_

_他们在你身边，却不属于你。_

_你可以给予他们的是你的爱，而不是你的思想，_

_因为他们拥有自己的思想。_

_你可以庇护的是他们的身体，而不是他们的灵魂，_

_因为他们的灵魂栖居于明日之屋，那是你无法探访的所在，即便在梦中，也难以企及。_

_你可以拼尽全力变得像他们一样，而不要让他们变得像你一样。_

_因为生命不会逆行，也不在过去停留。_

_你是弓，你的孩子是从你这里发射出的生命的箭矢。_

_那伟大的弓箭手，早已瞄准了无限之路上的一点。_

_命运的神力将你引满，使生命的箭矢能迅疾而遥远地射出。_

_请让你在弓箭手手中弯曲的过程，充满喜悦与感恩；_

_因为祂既钟爱那疾飞的箭，也同样珍视那稳定的弓。_
